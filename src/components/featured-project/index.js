              <h2>Excella Retro</h2>
              <p>Excella Retro is an app that makes it convenient for a facilitator to hold retrospectives with team members, whether they are remote or present in the room. Retro is a real-time app that negates the need of an additional screen sharing software. Its sign-up free design allows for anonymous gathering of feedback from any team member with a smartphone, tablet or computer. All members can participate in a dot voting exercise to prioritize items that needs improvement and observe action items being created based on the teamâ€™s conversation.</p>
