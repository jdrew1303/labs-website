    "description": "<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>All Agile and Lean approaches focus on collaboration: with customers, between team members, and with other stakeholders... But what does collaboration really mean? </p> <p>This workshop is centered around a simple simulation that has been used around the world to demonstrate how effective collaboration improves productivity. When teams voluntarily share the cognitive work, you can watch productivity soar! At the end, you will understand how to use a simple simulation to win a team's hearts and minds for real collaboration.</p> <p>We'll also explore some of the reasons behind this relationship discuss the importance of techniques such as teaming agreements that can help make work more collaborative.</p> <p><b>About the Speaker:</b></p> <p><img src=\"https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/7/b/7/600_457787031.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Paul Boos serves as a IT Executive Coach with Excella Consulting where where he works with all levels of management as well as teams supporting their transformation to Agile and Lean software development approaches.

    "description": "<p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p><br/>We think we understand that awkward teenager.</p> <p><br/>Many experienced testers will claim exploratory testing expertise, but too few have ever written an exploratory testing charter, and even fewer have applied a heuristic in that charter. We think we understand exploratory testing just as we think we understand teenagers, because “we have been there”. However the reality is that many of the words currently used in exploratory testing are foreign to us and we feel awkward about our lack of knowledge. As teams successfully adopt DevOps principles of continuous deployments and delivery, testers may be wondering how exploratory testing fits into a cadence where you are deploying daily to production.  The goal of this talk is to address these issues and remove the awkwardness of exploratory testing by giving people experience writing and executing exploratory testing charters, creating mind maps, and applying exploratory testing heuristics.  The talk emphasizes the expected outcome and value proposition of a successful exploratory testing program along with some lessons learned adopting such a program.</p> <p><b>About the Speaker:</b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/3/e/c/600_457645580.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Mr. Faunce has been building software systems in the government and commercial markets since 1993, with extensive expertise in databases.  His journey with Agile began in 2006.

Moving that fast may burn you, hard! Focusing on minimal tooling, and fewer frameworks will allow you to become an expert by going deeper, rather than stretching yourself too thin while achieving better results. Doguhan Uluca will talk about why Angular 2, npm and TypeScript are the right technologies to focus on in 2017. There'll be three segments to the talk.
